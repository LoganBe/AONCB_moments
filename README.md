## 📜 Abstract  
Even when driven by the same stimulus, neuronal responses are well-known to exhibit a striking level of spiking variability. In-vivo electrophysiological recordings also reveal a surprisingly large degree of variability at the subthreshold level. In prior work, we considered biophysically relevant neuronal models to account for
the observed magnitude of membrane voltage fluctuations. We found that accounting for these fluctuations requires weak but nonzero synchrony in the spiking activity, in amount that are consistent with experimentally measured spiking correlations. Here we investigate whether such synchrony can explain additional statistical features of the measured neural activity, including neuronal voltage covariability and voltage skewness. Addressing this question involves conducting a generalized moment analysis of conductance-based neurons in
response to input drives modeled as correlated jump processes. Technically, we perform such an analysis using fixed-point techniques from queuing theory that are applicable in the stationary regime of activity. We found that weak but nonzero synchrony can consistently explain the experimentally reported voltage covariance and skewness. This confirms the role of synchrony as a primary driver of cortical variability and supports that physiological neural activity emerges as a population-level phenomenon, especially in the spontaneous regime.
